# p5.js Flappy Bird

An implementation of flappy bird using the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) graphics framework. 

## Requirements

- Node

## Installation

`npm install`

## Development

`npm start` to build the files and start the web server.

As a p5 project, knowledge of the framework would help. [Here are the docs.](https://p5js.org/reference)

This project is powered by the [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) task runner, though familiarity with gulp isn't required as the current setup should be satisfactory.
