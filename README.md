# Phaser Flappy Bird

An implementation of flappy bird using the [Phaser.js](http://phaser.io/) game framework. 

## Requirements

- Node

## Installation

`npm install`

## Development

`npm run start` to build the files and start the web server.

As a Phaser project, knowledge of the framework would help. [Here are the docs.](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html)

This project is powered by the [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) task runner, though familiarity with gulp isn't required as the current setup should be satisfactory.
